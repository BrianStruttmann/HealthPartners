This project is written in response to Health Partners coding exercise.

Notes:
1) Run the **process_hospital_files.py** script to read and convert CMS Hospital data.
2) Metadata for script runs (last run date and file process counts) are stored in the **run_list.csv** file.
3) To simulate the first time running this script, delete **run_list.csv** and the script will re-create this file when it runs.
4) All files downloaded from the CMS site are saved in the "output" folder here.  There are some example files currently in this folder.

Thanks!
